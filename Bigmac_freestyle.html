Bigmac Freestyle:

Strophe 1:

Walkin down the street when i see a big MAC	
He was lookin at me wierd so i asked if he was on crack	
He had a big rack
Big Mac Looked at me 
said where are we	
I told him china, 
he comes from north carolina(idk was ich hier tun soll)
Ive been livin in da hood all theese years,
biggies dick is ollies greatest fear
giorno took mac in the rear
he was opening a lock,
harder than a rock
with a smol co-
Refrain:

I took the Mac... to Poland
I took the Mac... to Poland
I took the Mac... to Poland
Strophe 2:

Ducky on the track,
hit him in the sack
ollie in the club,
biggie on the hub
Eating some food, 
watching biggie kick a dude
I said thats rude
He sent me his nudes
Biggies Lookin down
right at the victory crown
playin fortnite 
ollie has no height
Biggie watches JoJo
livin like a hobo
Refrain:

I took the Mac... to Poland
I took the Mac... to Poland
I took the Mac... to Poland
Strophe 3:

Biggie in the street
beatin his meat
He sees lil levis listening to some rap
he says: That sh*t sounds like crap
In the evening he watches Star wars
Then he spent the night, 
doing fnaf lore
the pc was bright
then he ate his kite
Ollie felt cold
mac said: Ur old
Brander showed up
Biggie handed him a cup
It was filled with Wine
Thomas Haarig is a swine(Joke)
Ollies standing in a line
Refrain:

I took the Mac... to Poland
I took the Mac... to Poland
I took the Mac... to Poland
Strophe 4:

Mac is playing spider man
Sachsi gave gianni the ban
He uses admin powers
Biggies been playing for 20 hours
Im flyin a plane to the twin towers(JOKE)
Mac has a BBC
His dad hurt his knee
Levis is an emo
Mac has a big bow
Brander eats small crows
Marko has no hoes

I swallowed shampoo
prolly gonna die
smelled like fruit
that was a lie
Refrain:

I took the Mac... to Poland
I took the Mac... to Poland
I took the Mac... to Poland
